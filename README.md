# React Gallery App

For this project, I used the very popular UI Library React Js to create an image gallery app and using the powerful Create React App tool, I setted up the initial project.

I have done:

* Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
* Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
* Used the tool Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in the app.
* Add logic to handle the search input.
